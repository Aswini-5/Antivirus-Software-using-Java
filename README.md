Features of the Antivirus Software
File Scanning:

Single File Scan: Allows users to select and scan individual files for potential threats.
Directory Scan: Scans all files within a selected directory recursively, including files in subdirectories.
Logging and Reporting:

Real-Time Logging: Provides detailed logs of the scanning process, including the start, progress, and results of each scan operation.
Error Reporting: Logs any errors encountered during scanning, such as issues reading files or detecting malware.
User Interface:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Features a user-friendly GUI with buttons for initiating scans and monitoring, and a text area for displaying logs and results.
File and Directory Selection: Utilizes file choosers for selecting files and directories to scan.
Real-Time Monitoring:

Directory Monitoring: Allows users to monitor a selected directory in real-time for new or modified files, and scan them as they are added or changed.
Signature-Based Detection:

MD5 Hashing: Uses MD5 hashing to generate file signatures and compare them against a database of known signatures to detect malicious files.
Heuristic-Based Detection:

Behavior Analysis: Includes heuristic analysis based on file signatures to identify potentially new or unknown threats (though not explicitly implemented in this code, it's a common feature in antivirus systems).
Error Handling:

Exception Handling: Catches and logs exceptions that occur during file scanning and directory monitoring.
